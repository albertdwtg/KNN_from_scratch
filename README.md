# KNN_from_scratch
Creation  of a KNN from scratch with a genetic algorithm in order to optimize parameters and increase accuracy.

The goal of this task is to find the right "quality" class for each records of the Wine Quality dataset. It's a multiclass classification problem.
Size of the dataset : 1143 rows and 12 columns
Running time of one knn : 2 seconds

Accuracy of a knn without parameter optimization and k=5 : 51%
Accuracy of a knn after parameter and k optimization : 62,59%
